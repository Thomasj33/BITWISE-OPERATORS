# BITWISE-OPERATORS

Bitwise operators are operators (just like +, *, &&, etc.) that operate on ints and uints at the binary level. This means they look directly at the binary digits or bits of an integer. This all sounds scary, but in truth bitwise operators are quite easy to use and also quite useful
DIFFERENT TYPES OF BITWISE OPERATORS
& (bitwise AND)
| (bitwise OR)
~ (bitwise NOT)
^ (bitwise XOR)
<< (bitwise left shift)
>> (bitwise right shift)
>>> (bitwise unsigned right shift)
&= (bitwise AND assignment)
|= (bitwise OR assignment)
^= (bitwise XOR assignment)
<<= (bitwise left shift and assignment)
>>= (bitwise right shift and assignment)
>>>= (bitwise unsigned right shift and assignmen
